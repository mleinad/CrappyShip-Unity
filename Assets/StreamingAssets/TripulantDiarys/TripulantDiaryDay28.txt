<b>Tripulant Diary - Day 28</b>  
<i>Location:</i>Approximately 0.8 AU from MARS. 
<i>Status:</i>Terminal systems back ON.

We managed to turn back on some terminal systems but the AI should have turned them back on.

Probably some connectors froze and when we restarted might have been damaged because of humidity.

There are some problems but im still excited to go to MARS and to see my favourite animated character in real life: Marvin the Martian.

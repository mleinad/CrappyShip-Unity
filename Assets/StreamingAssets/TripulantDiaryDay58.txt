<b>Tripulant Diary - Day 58</b>  
<i>Location:</i>Approximately 0.4 AU from MARS. 
<i>Status:</i>Engines stable but off. 

We have managed to stabilize the engines but we cant turn them on.

We think its probably some kind of problem in the conectors of the eletrical part of the engine.
If that doesnt work we will have to try something else.....

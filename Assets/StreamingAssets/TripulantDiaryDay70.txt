<b>Tripulant Diary - Day 70</b>  
<i>Location:</i>Approximately 0.2 AU from MARS. 
<i>Status:</i>Systems strangely stable.  

We are almost there but, something doesnt feel alright.

The systems are odly stable, it feels like they just activate on its own.
We checked the engines and they are just fine. Just 10 hours ago the couldnt function properly.

THIS IS STRANGE.

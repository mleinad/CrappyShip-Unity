<b>Operations Log - Day 27</b>  
<i>Location:</i> En route to Mars  
<i>Status:</i> Systems partially operational  

Power fluctuations persist in the <color=#FFD700>main drive core</color>. Weâ€™ve isolated the issue to a 
<color=#FF4500>misaligned thermal regulator</color> but need additional time to make the fix.
Life support and critical systems remain <color=#32CD32>stable</color>, 
though <color=#FFA500>backup reserves</color> are running low.  

Crew is holding up, but the delays are starting to weigh on everyone.
Still no estimate on when propulsion will return to full capacity.
Proceeding with manual adjustments tomorrow.
